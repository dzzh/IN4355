%-About the reports: you are expected to write around 10 pages, but not focus on quantity; instead focus on quality. A good report should explain the application domain, the existing approaches to building similar applications, a decomposition of the approach you have taken (e.g. high level architecture, design), the implementation with a focus on the functional programming techniques you have used and finally an evaluation of your approach. The deadline for the reports is Fri Nov 9.

This report describes the project completed by the author during IN4355 Functional Programming course at TU Delft. The project goal was to implement two classification algorithms in a functional style using Python programming language.

\section{Introduction}

Any publisher of a quality newspaper, being it merely digital, paper-only or available in both forms aims to provide his customers with the best service possible. Before invention of the Internet, the owners of newspapers and magazines were rather limited in technical means they used to improve the satisfaction of their readers. They could print either in black and white or in color, use newsprint or coated paper and that was mostly it. They could have changed the outlook of the print, but not the way the information was presented.
