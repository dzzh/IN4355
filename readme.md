#IN4355 Functional Programming

This repository contains the source code of two experiments performed during IN4355 Functional Programming course at TU Delft. Both experiments were completed using Python programming language.

The first experiment contains an implementation of a 3d-model viewer rendering models from input files. The major challenge of this project was to write conversion function to do the rendering using only right triangles. The source code of this experiment can be found in `teapots` directory. Run `python teapot.py` and see what happens.

The second experiment is an implementation of machine learning algorithms in functional style. For this project, naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifiers were implemented. They work with the data sets from [UCI ML Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). More information about this project is provided in the [report](https://github.com/dzzh/IN4355/report/[in4355]%20zaleznicenka.pdf)

Enjoy!
